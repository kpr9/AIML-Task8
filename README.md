# AIML-Task8

# Bank Marketing Subscription Prediction using Decision Tree

# Tools Used
  * Python
  * Pandas
  * Scikit-learn
  * Matplotlib

# Steps
  1. Loaded the Bank Marketing dataset
  2. Handled missing and unknown values
  3. Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding
  4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
  5. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier with limited depth
  6. Visualized the Decision Tree for interpretability
  7. Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report
  8. Compared training and testing accuracy to check overfitting

# Outcome
  1. Gained hands-on experience with interpretable machine learning.
  2. Learned how to extract human-readable decision rules from a Decision Tree model.
  3. Understood overfitting control using tree depth limitation.
